# 🧾 Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts **weekly sales** for retail stores using historical data and various economic indicators.  
It applies **time series feature engineering** and **machine learning models** to forecast future sales.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict future weekly sales.  
- Analyze the impact of temperature, fuel prices, and unemployment.  
- Improve retail planning and inventory management.

---

## 🧠 Skills Gained
- Regression modeling (Random Forest, Linear Regression)  
- Feature engineering (date-time features)  
- Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)  
- Real-world data cleaning and visualization  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Loading** — Import and inspect dataset.  
2. **Data Cleaning** — Handle missing values and fix date formats.  
3. **Feature Engineering** — Extract Year, Month, Week from Date.  
4. **Model Training** — Train ML models for prediction.  
5. **Evaluation** — Measure MAE, RMSE, and R² for accuracy.  
6. **Visualization** — Show feature importance and sales trends.  

---

## 📈 Results
- Achieved strong prediction accuracy using Random Forest.  
- Identified key sales drivers (temperature, CPI, fuel price).  
- Demonstrated business value in retail forecasting.
