## 🚀 Steps  

1. **Import dataset automatically** using KaggleHub.  
2. **Explore and clean data** (handle missing values, fix outliers).  
3. **Encode categorical features** using LabelEncoder.  
4. **Split data** into training and testing sets.  
5. **Train model** using Random Forest Classifier.  
6. **Evaluate performance** using accuracy and confusion matrix.  
7. **Visualize feature importance**.  
8. **Save trained model** for future use.
